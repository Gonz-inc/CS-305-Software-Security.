# CS-305 Software Security. 
Gerardo Gonzalez. 
Southern New Hampshire University.  

## About.  

In this repository, I will demonstrate the skills I have learned from the CS-305 Course. 

Some Skills Include.  
* Analyzing Dependency Report. 
* Suppressing false positives. 
* Generating Certificates from keystore. 
* Implementing Software Security practices.  

## Course reflection.:mag_right:  

* This class assingnted me with the client Artemis Financial a consulting company that offered plans for their customers. In this scenario I played the role of a new hire software developer and was taksed to work in a new agile scrum team at Global Rain a software engineering company. The task was to constault and provide a plan to meet their needs which are to develop secure practices with there custom software by using modern day cipher and software security practices.  
<p> 

* What I did particularly well was learning how to refactor code and generating ssl certificates. Its important to refactor code so it can filter out any weaknesses in the software, and also generating and understanding how ssl certificates work can help a developer know what to look for in when hashing and find a way to validate data during transmission.  
<p>

* One part of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging to me was finding out which areas of security it addresses, this is because it can cross over multiple parts of each area. Following the vulnerability assessment, it helped guide me in the general direction to take when find vulnerabilities.  
<p> 

* During my time in this course I was introduced to dependency checking and maven tools, I also learned about certificate generation and HTTPS practices. All of these will be used later on as I progress through my degree to test code for vulnerabilities and practice more secure methods when developing code.  
<p> 

* To demonstrate the skills, I have done during this course I will show the second project that I have done on this course. As well as show the code and files that were refactored. In this document you will also see a screenshot of the generated certificate and key and keystore information from the java ketool.exe program.
